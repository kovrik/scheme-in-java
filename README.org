*Scheme R5RS Interpreter in Kotlin*

*Disclaimer*

This is a hobby project and work is still in progress.

*Description*

This is my attempt to implement Scheme R5RS (http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/) interpreter in Kotlin.
The goal is to have +some fun+ Scheme implementation which is as close to R5RS as possible.

On the other hand, this is a sandbox project where I'm trying different techniques and doing some experiments (for learning purposes mostly).
Also, I'm trying to make code simple, readable and easily understandable.

See TODO.org list additional information.

*Known issues/Not implemented yet*

1. No compiler yet
2. No macros yet
3. One-shot continuations only
4. Various bugs and issues
